This project aims to analyze the Indian Premier League Auction 2025 data focusing on bidding patterns and value players, with a specific focus on uncapped players â€” those who have not yet played for India in international cricket.  The project includes a comprehensive analysis of the Top 10 Uncapped Players based on their winning bids during the auction, as well as visualizations to showcase how these players were valued relative to their capped counterparts.
